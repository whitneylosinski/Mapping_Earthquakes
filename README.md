# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to plot GeoJSON earthquake data on different mapbox maps to easily identify the locations and magnitudes of all earthquakes occuring over the past 7 days.  The project showcases how to use mapbox layers and overlays to allow the users to choose which map design and data they'd like to see.
